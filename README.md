# cideros
hobby os made in python, not an actual installable iso but just a fun little project :P

## initial plan
i recently wanted to get back into hobby os development, mostly because i have too much free time lmao
- commandline
- partial implentation of rotur
- custom interpreted lang
- eventually graphical interface?
- simple kernel to handle storing data short term and running multiple processes
